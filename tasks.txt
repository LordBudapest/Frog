write the paper:
1) write the experiments
Experimental setup (datasets, baselines, metrics)

Main results table(s)

Ablations / key analysis

Implementation details (even rough)

2) Method

Now that results are clear, describe exactly what produced them.

Focus on:

Model / algorithm definition

Training objective

Any assumptions needed to understand experiments

Skip:

Fancy motivation

Deep theory (just enough to be coherent)

Think: “What must the reader know to reproduce Table 1?”

3) Minimal Theory / Background

Since you’re keeping this light:

Include only:

Definitions

Notation

One or two propositions/lemmas if strictly necessary

Everything else → appendix or gone.

Rule of thumb:

If removing it wouldn’t break the experiments section, it doesn’t belong in the main paper.

4) Introduction

Now you know:

What works

What’s novel

What actually matters

Write:

Problem statement

Why existing methods fall short (based on your results)

Clear bullet-point contributions (derived from experiments)

This goes much faster after steps 1–3.

5) Related Work

Second-to-last on purpose.

Why:

It’s easy but time-consuming

You now know exactly who you need to cite and why

Keep it:

Short

Comparative

Focused on differentiating your method

6) Conclusion (Last)

Always last.

Just:

Restate what you showed experimentally

One limitation

One future direction

If you’re exhausted, this can be ~6–8 sentences.
